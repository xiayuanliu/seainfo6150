# INFO6150 Week 8 Assignments

Due by the beginning of class, week 8 (February 26).

This week you will be practicing adding flexbox and grid to your components from last week.

## create a week-7 branch from your week-6 branch
You will be using the components you created last week for this week's assignment.

```
cd seainfo6150-webapp
git checkout week-6
git pull upstream master
git checkout --b week-7
```

## style the components
Update the styles for the ArticleList/ArticleListItem/ArticleImage/SlugButton components from week 6 to match <a href="./week-7-screenshot.png">this screenshot</a> as closely as possible. You should find that you use both flexbox and grid techniques to achieve the display.


## start the webapp

Start the webapp and verify that it is displayed as shown in <a href="./week-7-screenshot.png">this screenshot</a>.

```
npm start
```

## save it

save and commit your work to the week-7 branch and push to your fork

```
git add .
git commit -m "[your commit message]"
git push origin week-7
```

## send an email 
Send an email to Tianyu (20spr.info6150@gmail.com) with a link to your seainfo6150-webapp fork.
